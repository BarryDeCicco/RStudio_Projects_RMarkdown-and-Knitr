## Interactive Graphs with Plotly

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plotly_1, echo=TRUE}


library(plotly)

mtcars$car <- row.names(mtcars)



plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg,  type='scatter',
        text = ~paste("Car: ", car),
        mode = "markers", color = ~wt, size = ~wt)


```
